                About Me
            </h2>
            I'm a computer science student from Kathmandu, Nepal, with a passion for creating impactful digital experiences.
            My proficiency in web design using HTML, CSS, and basic JS has enabled me to create websites and complete projects using tools 
            like Vite, NPM, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and SASS. 
            <br /><br />
            I'm currently focusing on mastering ReactJS, an essential skill for frontend 
            web development and eventually continue my way through Node.js. Ultimately, my goal is to become a successful backend web developer who can bring innovative ideas to 
            life through the power of technology.While I don't have a concrete roadmap laid out ahead of
            me, I'm excited to explore new opportunities and challenges in this field.
